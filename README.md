## Problem
In order to solve the problem we have been give, we must compile the given data (email,login, date, time, etc.) and compile in into a report.
We must create a program that generates a report while also counting certain things such as irresponsible and suspicious behavior.

## Approach
In order to create the program we will be using a combination of loops, lists, and conditional statements. We will use these functions in order to gather information such as login, log out, time and more. Then we will compile the data into a lsist.  We will have to go make a loop to go through each of the insights. 
 
 ## Flowcharts
 The flowcharts are a visual representative of the algorithms.

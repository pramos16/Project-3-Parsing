# Project-3-Parsing
Team members: Paola Ramos, Charles Smith 

## Problem
In order to solve the problem we have been give, we must compile the given data (email,login, date, time, etc.) and compile in into a report.
We must create a program that generates a report while also counting certain things such as irresponsible and suspicious behavior.

## Approach
For this project we created 4 different codes for each of the four tasks and placed them in a python notebook. 
To generate reports we used a variety of things such as loops, lists, counts, file handling, and conditional statements. 

 Task #1: Suspicious Behavior 
This code consists of file handling and conditional statements. 
First we open and read the file we want. 
We then create a new textfile for the report that we would like. 

Using conditional statements we loop through the data 

 ## Flowcharts
 The flowcharts are a visual representative of the coding algorithms used to solve each of the tasks. Some of the flowcharts are broken up into two parts and others just 1.

# Project-3-Parsing
Team members: Paola Ramos, Charles Smith 

## Problem
In order to solve the problem we have been give, we must compile the given data (email,login, date, time, etc.) and compile in into a report.
We must create a program that generates a report while also counting certain things such as irresponsible and suspicious behavior.

## Approach
For this project we created 4 different codes for each of the four tasks and placed them in a python notebook. 
To generate reports we used a variety of things such as loops, lists, counts, file handling, and conditional statements. 

Task #1: Suspicious Behavior 
This code consists of file handling and conditional statements. 
First we open and read the file we want. 
We then create a new textfile for the report that we would like. This textfile is the same as the sample given.
We use conditional statements to loop throught the text to locate the data we need.
In this case we needed to count the number of suspicious activity, so we used a counter. 
Functions such as line.strip() are used to remove either the beginning or trail of a string. 

Task #2: Irresponsible Behavior
This code consists of a lot of file handling and conditional statements. 
We began by opening the file and creating a new list to store it in and
Using conditional statements we loop through the data that allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times.
Phrases such as for line in ___ makes it easy to sort through each line and find what we're looking for which in this case is suspicious activity.
For this code we had to make sure to define multiple variables such as log in and log out using operators.
Condtional statements such as "If" and "Else" execute statements looking for whether the conditions satisfy the requirements and print a response.
